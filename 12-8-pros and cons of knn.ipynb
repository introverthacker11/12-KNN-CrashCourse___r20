    "## Pros of KNN\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplicity and Ease of Understanding**: \n",
    "   - KNN is easy to understand and implement, making it a great choice for beginners in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No Training Phase**: \n",
    "   - KNN does not require a training phase like other algorithms; it simply stores the training instances and makes decisions based on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Versatile**: \n",
    "   - KNN can be used for both classification and regression tasks, making it a versatile algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adaptability**: \n",
    "   - KNN can adapt to complex decision boundaries as it does not assume any prior distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Effective for Small Datasets**: \n",
    "   - It works well with small datasets where the number of instances is manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cons of KNN\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computationally Intensive**: \n",
    "   - KNN can be slow and inefficient, especially with large datasets, as it requires calculating distances from the query instance to all training instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory Usage**: \n",
    "   - Since KNN stores all training data, it can consume a lot of memory, making it less suitable for very large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sensitive to Irrelevant Features**: \n",
    "   - KNN can be affected by irrelevant or redundant features, which can lead to poor performance. Feature scaling is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Curse of Dimensionality**: \n",
    "   - KNN may struggle in high-dimensional spaces where the distance metrics become less meaningful due to sparsity, leading to decreased accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Choosing the Right 'K' Value**: \n",
    "   - The performance of KNN can be heavily influenced by the choice of the parameter 'K', and selecting an optimal value often requires experimentation and cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Imbalanced Datasets**: \n",
    "   - KNN can perform poorly on imbalanced datasets, as it may favor the majority class if 'K' is not chosen carefully.\n"
